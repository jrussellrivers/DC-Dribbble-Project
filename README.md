# DC-Dribbble-Project

## Overview:
This project took place during the third week of the cohort. The goal of the project was to find a website and attempt to emulate it with HTML and CSS.
I managed to make a fairly responsive website that looked similar to the original. Since this project I have been able to make my designs look sleeker and more modern as well as more responsive in order to work on both desktop and mobile.
